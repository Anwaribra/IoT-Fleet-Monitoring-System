##  Features

### Vehicle Monitoring
- **Real-time telemetry** from multiple vehicle types (trucks, vans, motorcycles)
- **GPS tracking** with route simulation
- **Engine diagnostics** including temperature and performance metrics
- **Fuel level monitoring** with consumption tracking
- **Battery voltage monitoring**

### Anomaly Detection
- **High engine temperature** alerts (>110Â°C)
- **Low fuel level** warnings (<10%)
- **Excessive speed** detection based on vehicle type
- **Battery voltage** anomalies
- **Real-time alert generation** with severity levels

### Data Analytics
- **Hourly aggregations** of vehicle metrics
- **Fleet-wide statistics** and summaries
- **Historical data analysis**
- **Performance trends** and insights


##  Vehicle Simulation

The system includes a realistic vehicle simulator that generates:

### Vehicle Types
- **TRUCK_001, TRUCK_002**: Heavy vehicles with lower speed limits
- **VAN_001**: Medium vehicle with balanced performance
- **BIKE_003**: Motorcycle with higher speed capabilities

### Simulated Data
- **GPS coordinates** with route progression
- **Speed variations** based on traffic patterns
- **Engine temperature** correlated with load and speed
- **Fuel consumption** based on vehicle type and usage
- **Battery voltage** with realistic fluctuations
